<article> <h1> About Me</h1></article>
<p> I am Amira,I was born on August 22<sup>ed</sup>, so <em>August</em> is my precious month, alot of good things happen to me in it. I am a new student in Algonquin college, a new comer to Canada and a new resident of Ottawa. I love the weather in Canada but not the food, especially Poutine. I quite like the winter here but not the storms! I like the summer as well but not the heat waves. I also have a list of things that I can't pass my day without having them:</p>

<p> I would like to enjoy the two years of this diploma socially and functionally. I hope to gain the essential skills that are needed in the Canadian labour market accompanied with a network and friends. I would like to see this assignment at the end of my diploma and laugh about the silly struggles I am facing now<abbr title="Laugh Out Loud">LOL</abbr>.</p>
